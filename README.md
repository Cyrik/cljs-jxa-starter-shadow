# cljs-jxa-starter

Cocoa JXA(Javascript Automation) Hello World Application, written in
ClojureScript.
Updated for shadow-cljs and jdk 9+

## Usage

Just run `sh ./build.sh` or make it executable `chmod +x build.sh` and then run
`./build.sh`. This will execute the cljs as jxa and also build a compiled version.

The resources/compiled/app.app folder will have compiled version in resources/compiled/app.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt,
but resources/compiled/core.js can also be used as a jxa file.
